# Projects 

Materials for the Project in COGS108.

## Project Documentation 

* [Project Guidelines](https://github.com/COGS108/Projects/blob/master/FinalProject_Guidelines.md)
* [Team Policies](https://github.com/COGS108/Projects/blob/master/COGS108_TeamPolicies.md)

#### Final Report 

You will be graded on the one group notebook submitted on GitHub in your group's project repo (which will be created for you). **The name of the file should include your group's group number. (For example, if you were in group 001, your file would be named 'FinalProject_group001.ipynb'.)**

This single notebook should include all the code you used for all components of the project (cleaning, visualization, analysis). Because we won’t be running the code in your notebook, it is important to make sure your notebook as submitted to GitHub has the code evaluated and outputs present (e.g., plots) so that we can read the project as is.

Submission must be successfully completed by 11:59 PM on Wednesday, June 14th, and should be self-contained, so that we can evaluate your entire project from the notebook alone. Additionally, each individual group member must complete the team and individual feedback survey.

These notebooks will optionally be opened to the general public, so others may read what you’ve done! You will have the option to opt out of making your project public. 

#### Report Sections - Instructions

Each of the following sections corresponds to a section in the file FinalProject_groupXXX.ipynb (template is in your group's GitHub repo). 

For sections included in your proposal and previous checkpoints, you can copy and paste into your final project, but be sure to edit these sections with feedback you received on your proposal or additional information you learned throughout the project. This report should read clearly from start to finish, explaining what you did, why you did it, and what you learned. This should be a concise and well-written report.

**PERMISSIONS**: Specify whether you want your group project to be made publicly available. Place an X in the square brackets where appropriate.

**OVERVIEW**: Include 3-4 sentences summarizing your group’s project and results.

**NAMES**: See proposal specifications.

**RESEARCH QUESTION**: See proposal specifications.

**BACKGROUND & PRIOR WORK**: See proposal specifications.

**HYPOTHESIS**: See proposal specifications.

**DATASET(S)**: Same as Checkpoint #1.

**SETUP**: See Checkpoint #1.

**DATA CLEANING**: See  Checkpoint #1.

**DATA ANALYSIS & RESULTS**: This section should include markdown text and code walking us through the following:

* EDA (Same as Checkpoint #2, but clean visualizations up and feel free to remove unecessary visualizations)
  * What distributions do your variables take?
  * Are there any outliers? 
  * Relationship between variables?

* Analysis (Note that you will likely have to do some Googling for analytical approaches not discussed in class. This is expected for this project and an important skill for a data scientist to master.)
  * What approaches did you use? Why?
  * What were the results?
  * What were your interpretation of these findings.

* Data Visualization - There must be at least three (3) appropriate data visualizations throughout these sections. Each visualization must included an interpretation of what is displayed *and* what should be learned from that visualization. Be sure that the appropriate type of visualization is generated given the data that you have, axes are all labeled, and the visualizations clearly communicate the point you’re trying to make.

**ETHICS & PRIVACY**: See proposal specifications. (be sure to update with what you actually did to take the ethical considerations into account for the analysis you did!)

**CONCLUSION & DISCUSSION**: Discuss your project. Summarize your data and question. Briefly describe your analysis. Summarize your results and conclusions. Be sure to mention any limitations of your project. Discuss the impact of this work on society. (~2-3 paragraphs)


#### Video

Each group will submit a single 3-5 minute video on canvas communicating their group's final project. Only one member of each group will submit the video on Canvas, but the grade received will apply to everyone. This video will have to incorporate the visualization and effective communication strategies discussed in class. However, this can be creative. It is up to the group to decide how to most effectively communicate their project and results. 

All group members must participate in the completion of the video submitted; however, not everyone has to be on screen or talk in the video. How you delegate tasks here is up to the group. 

#### Grading 

Your final project report and video will be graded based on the rubric below. For the report, make sure you address each rubric section in the notebook, in an organized manner, using Markdown cells for textual descriptions. Note that you *can* add subsections or change up the organization, if your project would be clearer with you doing so.

The grading rubric for the Final Project is as follows: 

| Category  | Percentage of Project Grade | 
|---|---|
| Overview, Question, & Background | 10 |
| Data Description | 5 |
| Data Cleaning/Processing | 5 |
| Data Visualization | 15 |
| Data Analysis & Results | 25 |
| Ethics & Privacy | 10 |
| Conclusion & Discussion | 10 |
| Written Communication | 10   | 
| Oral Communication (video) |  10 | 

**Note**: Individual grades can be adjusted based on the feedback provided in individual surveys submitted. This means that team members in the same group can receive different scores from one another, if evaluations suggest that contributions were not evenly distributed. To avoid this, work together as a group and ensure that you’re contributing to the project.


## Final Project Checklist

Students often ask for a rubric. You can use this checklist to help guide your thinking on the final project. If you check off all the boxes below, you should be in good shape to get a perfect score on your final project.

### Overview, Question & Background

**Overview**:
- [ ] Write a clear summary of what you did
- [ ] Briefly describe the results of your project 
- [ ] Limit overview to 3-4 sentences

**Research Question**:
- [ ] Include a specific, clear data science question
- [ ] Make sure what you're measuring (variables) to answer the question is clear

**Background & Prior Work**:
- [ ] Include a general introduction to your topic
- [ ] Include explanation of what work has been done previously
- [ ] Include citations or links to previous work

**Hypothesis**:
- [ ] Include your team's hypothesis
- [ ] Ensure that this hypothesis is clear to readers
- [ ] Explain why you think this will be the outcome (what was your thinking?)

### Dataset(s):
- [ ] Include an explanation of dataset(s) used (i.e. features/variables included, number of observations, information in dataset)
- [ ] Source included (if outside dataset(s) being used)

### Data Analysis:

**Data Cleaning & Pre-processing**

- [ ] Appropriate analysis performed 
- [ ] Output of analysis interpreted and interpretation included in notebook

### Privacy/Ethics Considerations:
- [ ] Thoughtful discussion of ethical concerns included

- [ ] How your group handled bias/ethical concerns clearly described

### Conclusion & Discussion:
- [ ] Clear conclusion (answer to the question being asked) and discussion of results
- [ ] Limitations of analysis discussed
- [ ] Does not ramble on beyond providing necessary information

### Video:
- [ ] Question asked is clear to listeners

- [ ] Clear explanations throughout
- [ ] Take home message clear
- [ ] Within 3-5 min time limit

### Final Checks:
- [ ] Edit all text for clarity

- [ ] Check to make sure all text and images are visible
- [ ] Names included
- [ ] Renamed file : `FinalProject_groupXXX-Fa22.ipynb`, where 'XXX' is replaced by your group's group number

### After the course is done:
- If you checked YES to make project public: the final project notebook (and only that!) will be placed in a repo with the rest of this quarters public reports. This helps future students by providing examples!
- Your projct repo will remain available to you in the near future. We cannot guarentee that will always be the case. That repo will never be public.
- If you would like your own copy of the entire repo you should follow these instructions: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/duplicating-a-repository Once you have done that it is yours forever. You will also be able to control access to the mirror (make it public or private as you would prefer)
