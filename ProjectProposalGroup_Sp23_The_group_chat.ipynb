    "In our project, we will be working to create an algorithm that can classify animal noises. Although with the average human's capabilities, it should be easy to discern the difference between a cat's meow and a dog's bark, this is not as simple to program with technology. After some initial research, there are differences in a dog's bark and a cat's meow that can be distinguished by a machine. This is not a question that is unique, as there have been many studies and models that have been trained in a similar capacity. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, there is a study in which scientists created a neural network that has the ability to classify animal sounds. The algorithm was built with data consisting of recordings of marmoset monkeys in a loud environment. Their network is able to identify the animal that made the noise as well as the call type, by using spectrogram images [^1]. In another study from 2020, an algorithm is able to classify an animal sound from its dissimilarity to another animal sound. The classifier system was produced with Siamese neural networks (SNNs) and support vector machines (SVMs) to identify dissimilarity spaces of spectrograms [^2]."

    "1. Variables we would ideally have are audio length, decibels (how loud), species classification as a response variable.  (supervised dataset?)In the best situation the .wav files would be accompanied by a csv or json of numerical already preprocessed so we would not have to clean any of the data. For audio a dataset that is sufficiently large require less observations than necessary for other models since we would have to account for memory issues and such so around 2000 or more observations would be ideal. The observations would be sounds dogs and cats make, like meows, barks and howls. Again memory is theoretically an issue since long audio files could create noise and issues with memory as typically large files are not necessary and a compact csv or json is all that is needed.\n",
    "2. We have found a dataset through Kaggle that is a sample from a larger dataset of sounds including planes, humans, and traffic. This data is already readily available and it includes .wav files. Since there are no accompanying csv files we must make the table of variables ourselves which may prove challenging. The preprocessing will probably take the most time. This data is from the AE-Dataset creator which itself was made from FreeSound.
