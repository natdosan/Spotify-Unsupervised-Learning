Is there a relationship between the some of these features such as tempo correlating with danceability/energy/liveness and if so how are they correlated. Additionally, how can we use these features to cluster songs based on these audio tracks of songs being coverted to numeric features?"

This approach of comparing audio features between two groups can then be applied to other projects such as comparisons of living beings/objects to classify the two."
