    "1. Variables we would ideally have are audio length, decibels (how loud), species classification as a response variable.  (supervised dataset?)In the best situation the .wav files would be accompanied by a csv or json of numerical already preprocessed so we would not have to clean any of the data. For audio a dataset that is sufficiently large require less observations than necessary for other models since we would have to account for memory issues and such so around 2000 or more observations would be ideal. The observations would be sounds dogs and cats make, like meows, barks and howls. Again memory is theoretically an issue since long audio files could create noise and issues with memory as typically large files are not necessary and a compact csv or json is all that is needed.\n",
    "2. We have found a dataset through Kaggle that is a sample from a larger dataset of sounds including planes, humans, and traffic. This data is already readily available and it includes .wav files. Since there are no accompanying csv files we must make the table of variables ourselves which may prove challenging. The preprocessing will probably take the most time. This data is from the AE-Dataset creator which itself was made from FreeSound.
