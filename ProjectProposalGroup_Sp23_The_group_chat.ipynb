Although songs are not made scientifically there are obvious intentions when making music to fit a specific sound or genre. The data generating process comes from the Spotify api which provides us numeric data on songs and artists. With this we will try to classify songs based on their computational similarities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering based on musical similarities is actually the fundamental thought behind Spotify‚Äôs own recommender. In this video the the creator of the Spotify recommended system, Erik Berhardsson, describes his creative process and describes using matrix factorization to find similarities of songs which through interactions with users and their qualities. With this method genres cluster well meaning this evaluation of similarity works. He then used a method of approximate nearest neighbors where he could find similar tracks from the vector representations of these songs and their qualities and user interactions with the songs."

    "Certain audio features will be statistically different between the distribution of certain genres. \n",

    "\n",
    "If numerical data is extracted from the songs then models can be trained to cluster / classify songs into different groups since there will be enough difference between certain features between certain groups. These differences in distributions will allow us to perform Unsupervised Learning on the data to cluster the songs into different listening personas, which is different from the 'taboo' approach of just predicting song features (which is not as useful as identifying listening personas). This approach of comparing audio features between two groups can then be applied to other projects such as comparisons of living beings/objects to classify the two."
